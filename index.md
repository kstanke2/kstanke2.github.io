I am an educator, researcher, and advocate for inclusive, data-driven learning. My work focuses on integrating **computational thinking, AI literacy, and data science** into STEM education, ensuring that **all** students—regardless of background—have the tools to succeed in a rapidly evolving digital world. As a passionate mentor and curriculum innovator, I develop equitable, student-centered learning experiences that bridge theory, application, and industry relevance. My leadership in educational research, faculty development, and interdisciplinary collaboration reflects my commitment to fostering a _more diverse and accessible future in STEM._

Let’s connect and build the future of STEM education—where every learner belongs.
