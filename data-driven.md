# Data Driven: A Statistics & Data Science Field Day

## Competition Games Overview

Participants in **Data Driven** engage in five unique games, each designed to challenge their critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and statistical reasoning. Below is an overview of the events teams will compete in during the competition.

---

## 📈 [MARKET: Managing Risk & Reward](/market)

**Overview:**  
A game of probability, risk management, and strategy. Players accumulate points over multiple rounds while navigating market conditions that impact their success.

**Event Details:**

- Players roll two six-sided dice (2d6) each round.
- Rolling a **1** on either die results in a "scratch" (losing all points for that round).
- Before rolling, players decide to **"roll"** for more points or **"stay"** to secure their current total.
- The **Market State** (Boon, Bust, or Neutral) modifies final scores.
- The team with the highest **average** score after six rounds wins.

#### To practice dice mechanics, visit [MARKET Practice page](/market-practice).

## 🎲 [Game Design: Unfair Dice & Hypothesis Testing](/game-design)

**Overview:**  
Hypothesis testing is essential for scientific inquiry, helping us validate or refute assumptions using empirical data. In this game, teams will explore probability by designing experiments with unfair dice.

**Event Details:**

- **2 team members** will compete.
- Teams will be given **a hypothesis about a set of unfair dice**.
- Teams will have **30 minutes** to:
  - Design and conduct experiments to test their hypothesis.
  - Analyze results and determine whether the data supports or refutes their hypothesis.
- A written summary of findings on a guided worksheet is submitted for judging.

## 📊 [Data Stories: Communicating Insights](/data-stories)

**Overview:**  
Data analysis is crucial for drawing meaningful conclusions and driving innovation. In this game, teams will interpret data to tell a compelling story and propose a solution to a real-world challenge.

**Event Details:**

- **2 team members** will compete.
- Teams receive a **data packet** related to a STEM challenge.
- **30 minutes** to analyze data and prepare a **5-minute presentation**.
- Presentations must:
  - Interpret key figures and trends.
  - Identify a problem and propose a solution based on the data.
- Teams may use a whiteboard for visualization.

## 🎪 [Bayesian Circus: Predicting Probability](/bayesian-circus)

**Overview:**  
Bayesian statistics is a powerful method for updating predictions based on prior knowledge. This game challenges students to refine their probability estimates based on observed data.

**Event Details:**

- All four team members compete **independently**.
- Players analyze a jar of 'jelly beans':
  - Three sub-samples of a target color are provided.
  - Players estimate the proportion of the target color in the full jar.
  - After each round, new samples allow players to refine their estimates.
- Scoring is based on how accurate and precise the predictions are.

---

## 🔢 [Input-Output: Deciphering Patterns](/input-output)

**Overview:**  
Mathematical reasoning and pattern recognition are key problem-solving skills. In this game, teams will compete head-to-head to identify hidden rules governing input-output relationships.

**Event Details:**

- All four team members compete.
- Teams are shown input-output pairs.
- Individuals take turns predicting the next output given a new input.
- Points are earned for correct guesses.
