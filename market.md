# 🏦 MARKET: The Probability & Risk Management Challenge 🎲

## **📌 Overview**

Welcome to **MARKET**, a high-stakes game where **probability and risk management** determine your success!

## **🎯 Objective**

- Earn as many points as possible over **six rounds**.
- Each round, decide whether to **test the market (ROLL) or STAY**.
- Manage risk based on **market conditions** (**Boon, Neutral, Bust**).
- The team with the **highest average score at the end wins**!

---

## **🎲 How to Play**

### **1️⃣ Market Conditions Are Set**

At the start of **each round**, the **Dice Master (DM)** rolls a **d3** to determine the market condition:

| 🎲 **Market Roll** | **Market Condition** | **Effect**                                 |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **1**              | **Bust**             | All points this round **decrease by 15%**. |
| **2**              | **Neutral**          | No change—points remain as rolled.         |
| **3**              | **Boon**             | All points this round **increase by 35%**. |

🔹 Each market condition has **equal probability (1/3 chance)** of occurring each round.

---

### **2️⃣ Players Decide to TEST THE MARKET or STAY**

Each player on the team **individually** decides:

- **TEST THE MARKET 🎲** – Participate in rolling **two six-sided dice (2d6)** to earn points.
- **STAY ⏸** – Lock in points from previous rolls in this round and **avoid risk**.

**⚠️ The Catch:**

- **All players who decide to test the market roll the same 2d6 result**—the market is shared!
- If **either die rolls a 1**, the **entire market scratches** (earning **0 points for the round**) for anyone who choose to take the risk.

**🔹 The dice roll independently and fairly.**

- Each die has an **equal probability of rolling any number from 1 to 6**.

---

### **3️⃣ Testing the Market & Applying Adjustments**

1. **The Dice Master rolls 2d6**, determining the **market test result**.
2. Players who **tested the market** receive the **sum of both dice** as their base score.
3. If a **1 appears on either die**, the market **scratches** (players who rolled earn **0 points** for the entire round).
4. The **market condition modifies scores** for those who successfully rolled:

- **Bust** (-15% penalty)
- **Neutral** (no change)
- **Boon** (+35% bonus)

**Example Scoring for a Player Who Tests the Market:**

| **Dice Roll (Market Test)**   | **Base Score** | **Bust (-15%)** | **Neutral (0%)** | **Boon (+35%)** |
| ----------------------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| **7**                         | 7 pts          | 6 pts           | 7 pts            | 9 pts           |
| **10**                        | 10 pts         | 8.5 pts         | 10 pts           | 13.5 pts        |
| **Scratch (1 on either die)** | 0 pts          | 0 pts           | 0 pts            | 0 pts           |

---

### **4️⃣ End of Round & Team Average is Calculated**

1. Play continues until a **1 is rolled** or all players choose to stay.
2. The game moves to the **next round**!
3. There are **6 rounds**, one for each letter of MARKET.

---

## **🏆 Winning the Game**

- The team with the **highest average score** after six rounds **wins the MARKET challenge**!
- If there’s a **tie**, the team with **fewer scratches** wins.
