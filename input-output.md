# 🔢 Input-Output: Deciphering Patterns

## **📌 Overview**

Mathematical reasoning and pattern recognition are **key problem-solving skills**. In this game, teams will compete **head-to-head** to uncover **hidden rules** governing input-output relationships.

Teams must **analyze given input-output pairs**, predict future outputs based on patterns, and earn points for correct answers. The challenge requires **quick thinking, logical reasoning, and strategic decision-making**.

---

## **🎯 Objective**

- Identify **the hidden rule** connecting input values to output values.
- Use logic and **pattern recognition** to predict **future outputs**.
- Earn points for **correct predictions** in a structured, **rotating format**.

---

## **📋 Event Details**

- **All four team members compete**.
- Teams will be presented with **several given input-output pairs** at the start of the game.
- **One member at a time** will attempt to **predict the next output** based on a given input.
- **Points are awarded for correct answers**.
- The game continues until all outputs are revealed or the time limit is reached.

---

## **📝 Game Rules & Flow**

### **1️⃣ Initial Input-Output Display**

- A set of **initial input-output pairs** (e.g., four pairs) is displayed to all participants.
- Teams have **one minute** to **study the given data** and look for a pattern.
- **No communication between teammates** is allowed during this phase.

---

### **2️⃣ Rotating Turn-Based Guessing**

- Each round, an **input value** is presented to the next player in rotation.
- The player has **six seconds** to **guess the output** or say **“pass”**.
- If the guess is **correct**, the scorer says **"yes,"** the output is written on the board, and the next player attempts the next input.
- If the guess is **incorrect**, the scorer says **"no,"** and the turn moves to the next player to guess the same output.
- **The round ends when two outputs are correctly identified OR every participant has had a turn that round**.

---

### **3️⃣ Studying the Board Between Rounds**

- After each round, teams have **30 seconds** to **review all revealed inputs and outputs** before the next round begins.
- Players must remember previous results and refine their strategies.

---

### **4️⃣ Game Completion Conditions**

The game **ends when**:

1. **All outputs are correctly identified**, or
2. **The time limit (10 minutes) is reached**.

## **🏆 Scoring System**

| **Input Position**                                      | **Points per Correct Answer** |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **First half of unknown outputs** (e.g., positions 5-8) | **2 points**                  |
| **Remaining unknown outputs** (e.g., positions 9-16)    | **1 point**                   |

- **Players may only guess once per turn.**
- **No team discussion or external materials are allowed.**
- **Scores are totaled across all rounds.**

## **📅 Game Flow Summary**

| **Phase**               | **Action**                                                            | **Time Limit**         |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **1️⃣ Initial Study**    | Teams review the first few input-output pairs to determine a pattern. | **1 minute**           |
| **2️⃣ Guessing Rounds**  | Players take turns predicting the next output value.                  | **6 seconds per turn** |
| **3️⃣ Reflection Break** | Teams analyze revealed values before the next round.                  | **30 seconds**         |
| **4️⃣ End of Game**      | The game ends when all values are revealed or after 10 minutes.       | **10 minutes max**     |

---

## **🏅 Winning the Game**

- The **team with the highest total score** at the end wins.
- In the case of a **tie**, the team with the **fewest incorrect guesses** wins.

---

## **📜 Final Summary**

✅ **Logical reasoning and pattern recognition are essential to success.**  
✅ **Each round progresses as players attempt to determine the rule.**  
✅ **Teams must think ahead and refine their strategy over multiple rounds.**  
✅ **The team with the most points at the end wins.**

Good luck, and may the best pattern-solvers win! 🎯🔢
