# 🎪 Bayesian Circus: Iterative Guessing Challenge 🎲

## **Can You Infer the True Population from Limited Data?**

Welcome to **Bayesian Circus**, where your job is to **estimate the true distribution of colors in two mystery jars (Jar A & Jar B)** using probability, logic, and strategic guessing.

This game follows a **strict time limit per round**, and you will **track not just your best estimate, but also a confidence interval (+/- range) for each color**.  
Your goal is to **refine your estimates as accurately as possible while avoiding overcorrection**.

🏆 **Points are awarded based on accuracy and how well you adjust over time.**

---

## **📌 Game Objective**

Your goal is to estimate the **percentage of each color** in **Jars A & B** by progressively updating your guesses as **sample data** is revealed.

- Each round, a **new sample jar** and associated counts will be revealed to all participants.
- You must **update your probability estimates** for both Jars A & B within a **strict time limit**.
- You must also provide a **confidence interval (+/- range)** to show how certain you are about each estimate.
- **Overcorrecting by more than the allowed percentage results in a penalty.**

🧐 **Think carefully!** Each sample gives you a **better picture** of the whole, but you **never get to see the entire population!** Your job is to **make smart, measured updates** as you receive more information.

## **📝 How Confidence Intervals Work**

For each color estimate, you must **include a confidence interval**—a range that reflects how **sure** you are about your estimate.

- A **wide range (e.g., 30% ±15%)** means **you are unsure** and allowing for more error.
- A **small range (e.g., 30% ±3%)** means **you are confident** in your estimate.
- **As you get more data, your confidence interval should narrow!**

## **📝 Game Rules & Step-by-Step Guide**

### **🔹 Step 1: Initial Guess (Prior Belief - No Data Yet)**

1. You will receive a **Guessing Sheet** listing **Jar A and Jar B**.
2. **Without any data**, you must **estimate the percentage of each color** in both jars.
3. You must also provide a **confidence interval** (**+/- range**) for each color, representing your uncertainty.
   - Example Guesses:
     - **Jar A Guess:** 30% Green (**±10%**), 25% Red (**±5%**), 15% Yellow (**±15%**)…
     - **Jar B Guess:** 40% Yellow (**±10%**), 20% Red (**±8%**), 15% Green (**±12%**)…
4. You have **2 minutes** to submit your guesses before the round closes.

---

### **🔹 Step 2: Small Sample (First Data Revealed)**

1. A **pre-filled small sample** is revealed for **Jar A and Jar B**.
2. The **exact counts** for each color in the sample will be displayed for all participants.
3. You must now **revise your estimates** for Jar A and Jar B based on the new data.
4. Again, provide an updated **confidence interval** for each color.
5. You have **2 minutes** to submit your updated guesses.

---

### **🔹 Step 3: Additional Small Sample**

1. A **second small sample** is revealed for each jar.
2. The **exact counts** for each color in the sample will be displayed for all participants.
3. You **update your estimates and confidence intervals** based on this second sample.
4. **Overcorrection penalty applies:**
   - If your new estimate **changes by more than 20% from the previous round**, a **penalty** will be applied unless your final estimate is the closest to the true answer.
5. You have **2 minutes** to submit your updated guesses.

---

### **🔹 Step 4: Medium Sample**

1. A **medium sample** is revealed from **each jar**.
2. Participants update their guesses **again**, refining both their estimates and confidence intervals.
3. Overcorrection penalties **still apply** if estimates swing too much, but now the limit is **10%**.
4. You have **2 minutes** to submit your updated guesses.

---

### **🔹 Step 5: Larger Data Release**

1. Three **more** medium sample jars are revealed for each population.
2. Participants must now refine their guesses and **narrow their confidence intervals** as the data becomes clearer.
3. **Penalty for overcorrection still applies, and is now set at 5%**
4. **3 minutes** are given for updates before the round closes.

---

### **🔹 Step 6: Final Round**

1. A **large final sample** is revealed for each population.
2. Participants submit their **final estimates** and **confidence intervals**.
3. **Final scores are calculated.**

---

## **🚨 Overcorrection Penalty System**

🔺 If you **change your estimate by more than the allowed percentage**, you will receive a **penalty** unless your final guess is within **2% of the true proportion**.

- **Rounds 1-3:** Max correction = **20%**
- **Round 4:** Max correction = **10%**
- **Round 5:** Max correction = **5%**

This penalty encourages **small, logical updates** instead of wild swings!

## **💡 Strategy Tips for Participants**

✔️ **Avoid overcorrection!** Bayesian updating is about small, rational adjustments.  
✔️ **Confidence intervals matter!** If you're consistently narrowing your range, you're improving.  
✔️ **Pay attention to stabilization!** If a color’s proportion isn’t changing much, it’s likely close to correct.  
✔️ **Use the medium and large samples wisely!** They provide stronger data for accurate guessing.
