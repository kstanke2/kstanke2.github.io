# 🎲 Game Design: Unfair Dice & Hypothesis Testing

## **📌 Overview**

Hypothesis testing is essential for scientific inquiry, helping us validate or refute assumptions using empirical data. In this game, teams will explore **probability and randomness** by designing and conducting **experiments with unfair dice** to evaluate a given hypothesis.

Through this process, teams will engage in the **scientific method**, using controlled experimentation, data analysis, and reflection to determine whether the given hypothesis is supported by the evidence. This hands-on approach reinforces **critical thinking, data literacy, and statistical reasoning**—key components of STEM learning.

## **🎯 Game Theme: Unfair Dice & Hypothesis Testing**

Probability plays a crucial role in decision-making, particularly when faced with **biased or unpredictable outcomes**. **Unfair dice** have skewed probabilities, meaning some sides appear more often than expected in a fair roll.

In this event, teams will:  
✅ Apply **hypothesis testing** to analyze unfair dice.  
✅ Design **controlled experiments** to collect meaningful data.  
✅ Use **statistical reasoning** to interpret results and evaluate claims.  
✅ Communicate findings effectively through a structured **written report**.

## **📋 Event Details**

- **2 team members** will compete in this event.
- At the start of the competition, teams will be **given a hypothesis** about a set of unfair dice.
- Teams will have **30 minutes** to:
  - **Design and conduct experiments** to test their hypothesis.
  - **Analyze their results** and determine whether the data supports or refutes the hypothesis.
  - **Document their process and findings** in a guided worksheet for judging.
- **Judging will be based on the written summary of findings**.

### **🔎 Key Components of the Experiment**

🔹 **Hypothesis Evaluation** – Teams **do not create their own hypothesis**; instead, they **test a given hypothesis** using controlled experimentation.

🔹 **Experimental Design** – Teams must consider:

- Sample size: How many rolls are needed for reliable results?
- Data collection: How will outcomes be recorded systematically?
- Randomization: How will bias in rolling be minimized?

🔹 **Data Analysis** – Teams will compare observed results to expected probabilities, looking for statistical significance.

🔹 **Reflection & Reporting** – Teams will explain whether their results **support or refute the hypothesis**, discuss possible **errors or confounding factors**, and suggest **improvements** to their approach.

## **🔍 Example Hypothesis & Experiment Outline**

To illustrate the experiment, consider the **following example**:

**Hypothesis:**  
_"This set of unfair dice will land on even numbers 60% of the time."_

### **Steps to Test the Hypothesis**:

1. **Determine a sample size** – Teams must decide **how many rolls** to ensure a reliable test.
2. **Design an unbiased rolling method** – Teams must consider **how to eliminate accidental bias in rolling**.
3. **Record outcomes systematically** – Teams create a **data table** to track results accurately.
4. **Compare results to expected values** – If **even numbers appear close to 60%**, the hypothesis is supported. If **the observed probability is significantly different**, the hypothesis is refuted.
5. **Reflect on findings** – Teams discuss **what worked, potential sources of error, and how to refine their process**.

## **📜 Final Summary**

✅ **Teams receive a given hypothesis to test.**  
✅ **Experiments must be designed to ensure fairness, accuracy, and reliability.**  
✅ **Data must be recorded and analyzed systematically.**
